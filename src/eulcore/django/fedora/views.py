'''Generic, re-usable views for use with Fedora-based Django projects.
Intended to be analogous to `Django's generic views
<http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/topics/generic-views/>`_ .

Using these views (in the simpler cases) should be as easy as::

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
    from eulcore.django.fedora.views import raw_datastream

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        url(r'^(?P<pid>[^/]+)/(?P<dsid>(MODS|RELS-EXT|DC))/$', raw_datastream),
    )

'''

# TODO: add examples of easy ways to use this


from django.http import HttpResponse, Http404

from eulcore.fedora.util import RequestFailed
from eulcore.django.fedora.server import Repository

def raw_datastream(request, pid, dsid, type=None, repo=None):
    '''View to display a raw datastream that belongs to a Fedora Object.
    Returns an :class:`~django.http.HttpResponse` with the response content
    populated with the content of the datastream.  The following HTTP headers
    may be included in all the responses:

    - Content-Type: mimetype of the datastream in Fedora
    - ETag: datastream checksum, as long as the checksum type is not 'DISABLED'

    The following HTTP headers may be included `only` for non-xml and non-RDF
    datastreams (excluded there since they may be inaccurate depending on the
    serialization of the content):

    - Content-MD5: MD5 checksum of the datastream in Fedora, if available
    - Content-Length: size of the datastream in Fedora

    If either the datastream or object are not found, raises an
    :class:`~django.http.Http404` .  For any other errors (e.g., permission
    denied by Fedora), the exception is re-raised and should be handled elsewhere.
    
    :param request: HttpRequest
    :param pid: Fedora object PID
    :param dsid: datastream ID to be returned
    :param type: custom object type (should extend
        :class:`~eulcore.fedora.models.DigitalObject`) (optional)
    :param repo: :class:`~eulcore.django.fedora.server.Repository` instance to use,
        in case your application requires custom repository initialization (optional)
