eulcore.django.existdb is a django-aware extension of eulcore.existdb,
which provides methods to connect and query eXist databases.  For more details,
see eulcore.existdb.

When you create an instance of db.ExistDB, it will automatically load exist server
settings from django settings, using the configuration names documented below.

If you are writing unit tests against, you should include eulcore.django.testsetup
in your installed apps.  eulcore.django.existdb uses the pre- and post- test signals
defined by testsetup to temporarily switch the configured root collection to the
test collection, which it creates and destroys at the end.  Any ExistDB instances
created within the tests will automatically connect to the test collection.

Dependencies:
 * eulcore.django.testsetup


These settings should be added to settings.py::

  #Exist DB Settings
  EXISTDB_SERVER_PROTOCOL = "" # i.e. http:// or https://
  # hostname, port, & path to exist xmlrpc - e.g., "localhost:8080/exist/xmlrpc"
  EXISTDB_SERVER_HOST = "" # i.e. <server><port>/exist/xmlrpc
  EXISTDB_SERVER_USER     = ""  # Connection user id
  EXISTDB_SERVER_PWD      = ""  # Connection user password
  EXISTDB_SERVER_URL      = EXISTDB_SERVER_PROTOCOL + EXISTDB_SERVER_USER + ":" + EXISTDB_SERVER_PWD + "@" + EXISTDB_SERVER_HOST
  EXISTDB_ROOT_COLLECTION = "" # collection should begin with / -  e.g., /edc
  EXISTDB_TEST_COLLECTION = "" # test collection
