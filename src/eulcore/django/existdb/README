eulcore.django.existdb is a django-aware extension of eulcore.existdb,
which provides methods to connect and query eXist databases.  For more details,
see eulcore.existdb.

When you create an instance of db.ExistDB, it will automatically load exist server
settings from django settings, using the configuration names documented below.

If you are writing unit tests against, you should include eulcore.django.testsetup
in your installed apps.  eulcore.django.existdb uses the pre- and post- test signals
defined by testsetup to temporarily switch the configured root collection to the
test collection, which it creates and destroys at the end.  Any ExistDB instances
created within the tests will automatically connect to the test collection.
