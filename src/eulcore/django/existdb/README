:mod:`eulcore.django.existdb` is a Django-aware extension of
:mod:`eulcore.existdb`.

When you create an instance of :class:`eulcore.django.existdb.db.ExistDB`,
it will automatically configure an eXist database from the Django settings,
using the configuration names documented below.

If you are writing unit tests that use this module, you should include
:mod:`eulcore.django.testsetup` in your ``INSTALLED_APPS``.
:mod:`eulcore.django.existdb` uses the pre- and post- test signals defined
by :mod:`~eulcore.django.testsetup` to temporarily switch the configured
root collection to the test collection, which it creates and destroys at the
end. Any ExistDB instances created within the tests will automatically
connect to the test collection.  In addition, if your test cases extend
:class:`eulcore.django.test.TestCase`, you can make use of auto-loaded
eXist fixtures for your unit tests.

Projects that use this module should include the following settings in their
``settings.py``::

  #Exist DB Settings
  EXISTDB_SERVER_URL = "http://user:passwd@megaserver.example.com:8042/exist/xmlrpc"
  EXISTDB_ROOT_COLLECTION = "/sample_collection"

If you are using an eXist index configuration file, you can add another setting
to specify your configuration file:

  EXISTDB_INDEX_CONFIGFILE = path.join(BASE_DIR, "exist_index.xconf")

This will allow you to use the existdb_index management command to manage your
index configuration file in eXist.
