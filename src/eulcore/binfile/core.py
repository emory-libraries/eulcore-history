'''Map binary data on-disk to read-only Python objects.

This module facilitates exposing stored binary data using common Pythonic
idioms. Fields in relocatable binary objects map to Python attributes using
a priori knowledge about how the binary structure is organized. This is akin
to the standard :mod:`struct` module, but with more flexibility in placement
and size, at the cost of more verbose structure definitions and support only
for file-based structures.

This package exports the following names:
 * :class:`BinaryStructure` -- a base class for binary data structures
 * :class:`ByteField` -- a field that maps fixed-length binary data to
   Python strings
 * :class:`LengthPrependedStringField` -- a field that maps variable-length
   binary strings to Python strings
 * :class:`IntegerField` -- a field that maps fixed-length binary data to
   Python numbers

class BinaryStructure(object):
    """A superclass for binary data structures superimposed over files.

    Typical users will create a subclass containing field objects (e.g.,
    :class:`ByteField`, :class:`IntegerField`). Each subclass instance is
    created with a file and with an optional offset into that file. When
    code accesses fields on the instance, they are calculated from the
    underlying binary file data.

    Instead of a file, it is occasionally appropriate to overlay an
    :class:`~mmap.mmap` structure (from the :mod:`mmap` standard library).
    This happens most often when one ``BinaryStructure`` instance creates
    another, passing ``self.mmap`` to the secondary object's constructor. In
    this case, the caller may specify the `mm` argument instead of an
    `fobj`.

    :param fobj: a file object or filename to overlay
    :param mm: a :class:`~mmap.mmap` object to overlay
    :param offset: the offset into the file where the structured data begins

      This is actually one past the last byte of data, so a four-byte
      ``ByteField`` starting at index 4 would be defined as
      ``ByteField(4, 8)`` and would include bytes 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the

    When you instantiate the subclass and access the field, its length will
    be read from that location in the structure, and its data will be the
    bytes immediately following it. So with a file whose first bytes are
