eulcore,
being a collection of reusable Python components produced by Emory
University Libraries.

Note that there's a related repository called django-eulcore containing
reusable Django components. The current branch of python-eulcore (and a
related branch of django-eulcore) is a stab at integrating that code into
python-eulcore. It is our intention that this task will begin with including
the django-eulcore code as externals. Ultimately we will replace those
externals with the actual code, making this the official repository for
shared EUL django code.
