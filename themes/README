Overview
========
This directory contains seperate themes for use in various django sites.

The current practice of setting up theme directories is as follows

[theme_name]/ - root of theme add any docs and such needed here.
[theme_name]/[theme_name]_templates - Put Templates and such here as needed.
[theme_name]/[theme_name]_media - for media files related to the theme.

Right now the best method we can come up with is to include each of the
*_templates and *_media directories in your django templates and media
directories as SVN externals.

For specific implementations see the README files included in the theme
directories.
