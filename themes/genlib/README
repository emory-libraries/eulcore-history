This is an adaptation of the woodrufflibrary theme provided by SharpDot for use
in our Drupal Sites.

A significant amount of clean-up and adaptation has happened with it.  If you
need to pull in items from the original template please try to examine a
better or more consistant way of doing it from the original template if possible
keeping in mind extensability.
