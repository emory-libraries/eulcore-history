Overview
========
This is an adaptation of the woodrufflibrary theme provided by SharpDot for use
in our Drupal Sites.

A significant amount of clean-up and adaptation has happened with it.  If you
need to pull in items from the original template please try to examine a
better or more consistant way of doing it from the original template if possible
keeping in mind extensability.

Setup
------
* Use themes/genlib/genlib_templates as an external in your templates directory.
* Use themes/genlib/genlib_media as an external in your media directory.
* Setup a local base template in your template directory and extend
  themes/genlib/genlib_templates/site_base.xhtml in that file and override
  or extend blocks as needed.  See 
  themes/genlib/genlib_templates/example_local_sitebase.xhtml as an example.
* Place eulcore.django.util in your installed apps so the custom template
  tags work.

Two Theme Options
-----------------
There are two general options currently for themes.  The default is the Emory
blue and gold with social media tags.  Alternatively there is also a blue and
gray subtheme that is an override of the blue and gold theme.

**Blue and Gold Theme**
To use this just extend the genlib/site_base.xhtml in your main theme template
and follow the normal directions.

**Blue and Gray Theme**
To use this just extend the genlib/bluegray_site_base.xhtml in your main
template and follow the normal directions.
