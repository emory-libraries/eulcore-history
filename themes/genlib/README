This is an adaptation of the woodrufflibrary theme provided by SharpDot for use
in our Drupal Sites.

A significant amount of clean-up and adaptation has happened with it.  If you
need to pull in items from the original template please try to examine a
better or more consistant way of doing it from the original template if possible
keeping in mind extensability.

Setup
1. Use themes/genlib/genlib_templates as an external in your templates directory.
2. Use themes/genlib/genlib_media as an external in your media directory.
3. Setup a local base template in your template directory and extend
   themes/genlib/genlib_templates/site_base.xhtml in that file and override
   or extend blocks as needed.  See 
   themes/genlib/genlib_templates/example_local_sitebase.xhtml as an example.
4. Place eulcore.django.util in your installed apps so the custom template
   tags work.
