The primary navigation links for the blue-gray theme are meant to be equally spaced.
Currently, the CSS width is set for 7 tabs, but this width can easily be overridden
in your local CSS if you have a different number on your site.

Calculate the width of your tabs as follows based on the total number of tabs:
    (978-(x-1)*2)/x            where x is the number tabs

And add a width override to your local css file, e.g.:

    #navbar #primary a {
        width: 138px; 
     }

It is recommended to add "first" and "last" class attributes to the first and
last link elements in your navbar, in order to display correctly in browsers
that do not support :first-child and :last-child selectors in CSS.
